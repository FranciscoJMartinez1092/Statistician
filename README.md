# Statistician
First assignment from my data structures class. Contains the statistician class (stats.cpp) and the statistician helper class (stats.h) which I created. The statexam.cpp file was not created by me. The statistician class has 4 private variables, a constructor,  constant and modification member functions, non member and friend functions. The statexam.cxx file was used to test my statistician clas from my stats.cpp and stats.h files.
